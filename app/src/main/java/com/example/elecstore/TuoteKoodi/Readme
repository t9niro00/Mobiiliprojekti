We had to add "TuoteGet & TuoteGet2 and Ostoskori & Ostoskori 2" for the code to work properly.
numberless one gets it's data from "komponentit" library in our firebase database.
number 2 gets its data from "mikrokontrollerit" library in our firebase database.
otherwise these classes are identical, they just grab the data from a different library to get the
data we want.
